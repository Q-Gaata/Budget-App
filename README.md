# Budget-App
This is an app where you can have have your budgets calculated in every current Month.
It starts by taking your input each of your incomes descriptions and values which may be every day or every week.
As you input your incomes, it displays the value of your incomes and updates them.
It then calculates them and displays on the user interface so that you can see the amount of incomes you currently have
Then it does the same for the expenses too.
And you can also remove items from either the incomes or the expenses column and immediately you do that, it gets updated.
And lastly each of the expenses is calculated as a percentage of the incomes.
